I need to determine the intent, urgency, whether an action is required, and a suggested action.\n\n1.  **Analyze the message:**\n    *   **Sender:** ~ Paarth Mandelia\n    *   **Text:** \"Satyam bhaiya + Harsh bhaiya<< @~Aryan Jajodia\"\n    *   **Time:** 11:02 pm\n    *   **Type:** group\n\n2.  **Determine the intent:** The message consists of names and a tag. It doesn't ask a question, set a deadline, schedule a meeting, or provide specific information. It appears to be a casual mention or an attempt to get someone's attention in a group chat. Therefore, the intent is \"casual\".\n\n3.  **Determine the urgency:** The message was sent late at night and contains no time-sensitive language. The urgency is \"low\".\n\n4.  **Determine if an action is required:** The message is simply tagging individuals. It doesn't pose a question or a direct request. No explicit response or action is needed. Therefore, `action_required` is `false`.\n\n5.  **Determine the suggested action:** Since no action is required and the message is informal, the most appropriate suggested action is to \"ignore\".\n\nThe task is purely analytical and requires no device interaction. I can directly output the final classification as requested. The final output should be in a natural, readable format as per the output requirements.<request_accomplished success=\"true\">\n{\n  \"intent\": \"casual\",\n  \"urgency\": \"low\",\n  \"action_required\": false,\n  \"suggested_action\": \"ignore\"\n}\n</request_accomplished>",
