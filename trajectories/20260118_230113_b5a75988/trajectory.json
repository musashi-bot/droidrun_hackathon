There's no text indicating a task, question, or important information. This is typical of social, informal communication. Therefore, the intent is `casual`.\n    *   **urgency**: A photo with no context is not time-sensitive. It can be viewed at any time. Therefore, the urgency is `low`.\n    *   **action_required**: The message does not ask for a response or action. It's for viewing only. Therefore, `action_required` is `false`.\n    *   **suggested_action**: Since no action is required, the appropriate suggestion is to `ignore`.\n\n3.  **Format the output:** The final output must be a JSON object containing these classifications.
